Review Comments:
1. The code compiles and it is well-structured and named.
2. Its class and methods used are correct and appropriate.
3. It shows the method to describe the shape of the tile. The name consists of 3 letters 'h''r''#',
and it finds the relationship between different pictures, like when orientation is larger than 3, swap[1]
and[3]. And flip does the same thing.
4.Apparently the author did useful observing before coding. This method relies on observing so much.
5.It is better if there is more document.
6.There is no error in this method.
7.It is the basic method in he help method class, and this getshape method helps to translate the shape of 
tiles into more readable letters.
