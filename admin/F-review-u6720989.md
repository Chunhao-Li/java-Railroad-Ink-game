Review Comments:

1. The code compiles and it is well-structured and named.
2. Its class and methods are correct and appropriate.
3. It shows the method to describe the shape of the tile. The name consists of 3 letters 'h''r''#',
and it finds the relationship between different pictures, like when orientation is larger than 3, swap[1]
and[3]. And flip does the same thing.
4.Apparently the author did useful observing before coding.
5.It is better if there is more document.
